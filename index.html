<h1><p style="font-size: 30px">Is our society better now than it would have been without the computer revolution?</h1>

<p><p style="font-size: 20px">The premise that our society is different from what it would have been without the computer revolution is generally accepted. Is our society better than it would have been without the revolution? Is our society worse? Would your answer differ if your position within society were different? </p>

<u> Background </u> <br>
The computer revolution began in the 1960s, mainly helping businesses, and peaked again in the 1980s when households began to buy personal computers. Konrad Zuse started building computers in his parents' home in Berlin in 1936. Which he continued to develop and eventually finished in 1941. Being the first freely programmable computer ever built. Society and engineers have since progressed and built upon the basics of computer engineering. Bringing us to where we are today, it's almost impossible to go anywhere without seeing modern technology; such as phones, televisions, and computers. <br>

<p><u> Introduction </u> <br> 
Society would have been completely different if it weren't due to technology's widespread use; that's undeniable. Some people may argue that society is better, and some could say it is worse. While it doesn’t matter who is objectively right, there are some undeniably useful technologies that have come from the computer revolution. Such as easy communication, entertainment, and smart technology. <br>

<p><u> Body </u> <br> 
Communication is widespread due to today's technology. Yes, without the computer revolution, we could still communicate, but texting has made communication much faster. Sending an email will get a reply within 1-2 business days while sending a letter and getting a response would take about two weeks. Modern technology also allows people to work remotely from home. Which results in more jobs; benefiting the economy. There are many benefits to communication thanks to the computer revolution. <br>
Entertainment today is readily available; unlike seeing a medieval horse show or whatever happened before computers existed. Being able to subscribe to Netflix wouldn't have been possible without the advancements made in technology. People can stay at home, and watch the same movie they would have seen in the theatre. Which could help save money, and prevent the spread of disease.<br>
Smart technology has allowed convenience in our everyday lives. Smart devices also help to assist people with certain tasks who are not able to complete them alone. Such as Alexa, electronic mobility, and wearable technology. People who are not able to complete certain tasks on their own, such as cutting a bagel, or walking, probably benefit from smart technologies such as the infamous guillotine bagel cutter found on Amazon, and the invention of the electric wheelchair. <br>

<p><u> Rebuttal </u> <br> 
While there are so many positives that have come from the computer revolution, it is also important to recognize the setbacks seen in day-to-day life. People have lost social skills, would rather stay home and play video games, and can even order food at their door. All thanks to new technology from the computer revolution. However, not all of those things are purely from technology, Covid is also to blame. While being stuck at home for almost a year, people began to rely on technologies such as their computers for work, and phones for connections. Sadly, we as a society haven't recovered from isolation, and we probably will never do so completely.<br>

<p><u> Conclusion </u> <br> 
In conclusion, society could not have possibly been where it is today without the computer revolution. Society benefits greatly from technology. We see conveniences in everyday life such as easy, quick communication, entertainment, and smart technology. While there are some downsides to the computer revolution such as the modern lack of communication skills. It is what humans got used to while in quarantine, and the convenience did not go out of style. It is very common to own a smartphone nowadays. It would be impossible to walk down the street without seeing some form of modern technology. Therefore, society is better now than it would have been without the computer revolution. Although it didn’t start long ago, we benefit from it every day. Along with that, technology advances every day, which will benefit society in the long run.	</p>
